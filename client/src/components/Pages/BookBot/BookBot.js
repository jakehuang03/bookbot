The Product Owner is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, ensuring that the team works on the most valuable features. The Scrum Master serves as a facilitator and coach, helping the team understand and adhere to Scrum principles and practices. The Development Team is self-organizing and cross-functional, responsible for turning backlog items into a working product increment. Scrum emphasizes collaboration and transparency, with regular ceremonies such as daily stand-ups to keep the team aligned and focused on the sprint goal. Additionally, the sprint review and retrospective meetings promote continuous improvement, allowing the team to adapt to changing requirements and deliver better results with each sprint.",
